## Description
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic dice game Yahtzee, built using React. Players can roll dice, hold onto specific dice between rolls, and choose scoring categories to accumulate points. The game continues until all scoring categories have been used, at which point the playerâ€™s final score is calculated and displayed.

## Installation
To get started with the Yahtzee game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aidan-elliot/yatzy.git
   cd yatzy
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```
   npm install
   npm install @fontsource/inter
   npm install express
   npm install concurrently --save-dev
   npm install cors

   ```
3. **To start both the Express server and the React application**: 
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **To start one at a time**: 
   ```
   npm start
   node server.js
   ```

After running these commands, you should be able to access the application at `http://localhost:3000/` in your web browser.

## Usage
To play the game, follow the on-screen instructions:

1. **Roll the Dice**: Click the "Roll Dice" button to start your turn.
2. **Hold Dice**: Click on any dice you wish to keep for the next roll.
3. **Roll Again**: You have a total of three rolls per turn, including your initial roll. After holding onto any dice you wish to keep, click "Roll Dice" again.
4. **Choose a Scoring Category**: After your rolls, choose a scoring category from the scoreboard. Your score for that round will be calculated based on the dice you have and the category you choose.
5. **Continue Playing**: Continue playing until all scoring categories have been used. The game will then calculate your final score and display it on the screen.

## Game Rules
Yahtzee is played with five dice and a scorecard that has two sections: the upper section and the lower section.

- **Upper Section**: Consists of categories for each number (1 through 6). The score for a category in the upper section is the sum of all dice showing that number.
- **Lower Section**: Includes various combinations such as three of a kind, four of a kind, full house, small straight, large straight, Yahtzee (five of a kind), and chance. Each category has its own scoring rules.

The goal is to accumulate the highest score possible by rolling certain combinations and strategically choosing where to score your rolls.

## Code Design
The Yahtzee game is built using React, employing various React features such as functional components, hooks, and context.

- **Components**: The application is divided into reusable components, such as `Scoreboard`, `Gameboard`, `Navbar`, and `GameOverBanner`.
- **State Management**: The game state, including the current dice, held dice, scores, and available categories, is managed using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
- **Event Handling**: User interactions, like rolling dice, holding dice, and choosing scoring categories, are handled through event handlers passed down to child components as props.
- **Styling**: The game's styling is done using CSS, with class names assigned to different parts of the interface for easy styling and updates.
